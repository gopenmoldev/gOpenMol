<B>Join two Gamess IRC files to one
Leif Laaksonen CSC 2001</B>
**************************************************************************

Joining two Gamess irc-files.
Both files start with the same transtion state, one going
forwards and the other backwards.
The order of the coordinate sets is reversed in the first file
so the sequence in the result file is 

reactant(s) - transition state - product(s)

or in reversed order depending on the order in whih the files
are given.

The IRC file can be read through the GAMESS coordinate input reader.
The coordinate input reader produces a multi-coordinate file that
can be viewed using the trajectory facility.

The xmol file has the same name as the IRC file but with the xmol
extension.
