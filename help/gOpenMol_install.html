<h2>Steps to do to install gOpenMol on UNIX</h2>

<p>I'm only distributing gOpenMol (currently) as a binary
distribution, if you need the source code you have to get in
touch with me. The program is distributed free of charge for
academic installations and academic use. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Most likely you have just got a compressed tar file
        version of gOpenMol (gopenmol.tar.Z). You have to
        uncompress the file first with the command: </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><b>uncompress gopenmol.XXX.tar.Z</b> </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<ol>
    <li>Copy first the &quot;gopenmol.tar&quot; file to directory
        where you want to install gOpenMol. The tar file will
        create a directory &quot;gopenmol&quot; containg the
        needed subdirectories, programs and data. You can untar
        the tar file with the command: </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><b>tar xf gopenmol.xxx.tar</b> </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<ol>
    <li>Change directory down to the &quot;gopenmol&quot;
        directory</li>
    <li>Run the installation script &quot;install.csh&quot;
        with the command: </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><b>./install.csh</b></li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<ol>
    <li>You are now ready to use gOpenMol. To run gOpenMol write:
    </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><b>bin/rungOpenMol</b></li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Steps to do to install gOpenMol on Windows 95 and NT</h2>

<p>I'm only distributing gOpenMol (currently) as a binary
distribution, if you need the source code you have to get in
touch with me. The program is distributed free of charge for
academic installations and academic use.</p>

<ol>
    <li>You have got the gopenmol.zip file downloaded from the
        net. Take a program (WinZip is a good candidate) to unzip
        the file.</li>
    <li>Choose the directory where you want to download the
        program including the files. The unzip program creates a
        directory <b>gopenmol</b> and places the file in the
        respective directories.</li>
    <li>Change directory to the gopenmol directory and run the <b>install.bat</b>
        file. This procedure will call the wish shell and run the
        installation procedure. After the installation procedure
        you should have a new bat file in your gopenmol/bin
        directory called <b>rungOpenMol.bat</b>. This file starts
        gOpenMol and makes all the needed environment
        assignments. </li>
    <li>Run the script <b>rungOpenMol.bat</b> always when you
        want to run the gOpenMol program.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Uninstall gOpenMol</h1>

Both the Unix and the Windows versions can be removed by just deleting
the root directory and the directories under the root.
<P>
The Windows version uses no register entries and places no files in the
system directory.
