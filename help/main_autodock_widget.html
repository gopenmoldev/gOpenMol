<P>
This is the main widget for the <b>AutoDock</b> trajectory display and 
analysis facility.
<p>
There are first 4 file readers:
<p>
<ul>
   <li>Read a *.pdbq file or several files(ligans)</li>
   <li>Read a *.pdbq file (system into which the ligand is docked)</li>
   <li>Read the AutoDock trajectory (a .tout file)</li>
   <li>Read an AutoDock log file to extract the included initial
       and docked coordinate sets. The cruncher creates a set of files
	   with the coordinates</li>
</ul>
<p>
With an AutoDock trajectory I mean the "ligand.tout" file as in the following:
<p>
The traj command which is used in the trajectory output, creates trajectories 
in two formats, one in PDB format which is written to the log file specified 
by the -l flag, and one in a raw ASCII format which is written to 
the standard output. For example, if the command issued was: 
<p>
<b>autodock -p ligand.dpf -l ligand.trj.conv.log -c < trj.conv.com > ligand.tout</b> 
<p>
the file ligand.trj.conv.log will contain a PDB formatted list of all 
the trajectory steps, while the ligand.tout file will contain raw ASCII 
data, with one row for each atom in the ligand, and each column 
containing data. The command file trj.conv.com contains only the commands:
<p><em>
traj ligand.trj<br>
stop
</em><p>
This was taken from Web pages and manuals at: <br>
http://www.scripps.edu/pub/olson-web/doc/autodock/ 
<p>

gOpenMol is again calling this .tout file a .trj file but it should
not be mixed with the original .trj file. A bit confusing I agree!
To read and display a trajectory from the AutoDock do the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>First define the file name of the ligand either by directly writing
    the file and or by using the file browser. Then press the "Import"
	button to apply the file. It is possible to read several
    conformations of the ligand by clicking the "Append structure".</li>
<li>If you also want to include the system (into which the ligand is
    docked) do the same as in the previous section but for the system.</li>
<li>Last but not least define the trajectory file. Use the same approach
    as in the previous sections. Remember to press the "Import" button.</li>
</ol>
<p>
After this you should be able to see the number of frames displayed.
<p>
By default the display goes from the first frame to the last with the
step 1. This can be changed by supplying new values in the respective
fields.
<p>
It is possible to display the trajectory in a loop, one frame at the
the backwards and forwards or go to the first and last frames.
<p>
Frame control:
<p>
<UL>
     <li> <b>|&lt;</b>... go to first frame</li>
     <li> <b>&lt;</b>... back one frame</li>
     <li> <b>[]</b>... halt display loop</li>
     <li> <b>|&gt;</b>... play forward one frame at the time in a loop</li>
     <li> <b>&gt;</b>... forward one frame</li>
     <li> <b>&gt;|</b>... go to last frame</li>
</UL>
<p>
There are two trajectory retrieval methods available:
<ol>
<il>The <b>fast</b> method uses a pre-calculated index (jump) vector
    into the trajectory file for the various frames. This method is
	capable of retrieving a frame at a speed independent of the
	frame position in the file. However, be careful
	with this if you move files between Unix and Windows systems!</il>
<il>The slow method is a "stupid" read process that always reads all 
    the frames up to the needed frame. This process becomes very
	slow for big files but it is not sensitive to the characters
	at the end of the line.</li>
</ol>
<p>
At the bottom of the widget there is also a file writer to write out
the ligand and system coordinates as *.pdbq files. This is very handy 
in case you import the atom partial charges and want to write a *.pdbq
file with the new charges.
