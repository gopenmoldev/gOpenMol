<b>Modified from the XMOL help files</b>
<P>
XMOL(XYZ) datafiles specify molecular geometries using a Cartesian
coordinate   system. The XMOL(XYZ) format supports multi-step datasets.
Each  step  is represented by a two-line "header," followed by one line for
each atom.
<P>
The first line of a step's header is the number of atoms  in
that step.  This integer may be preceded by whitespace; any-
thing on the line after the integer is ignored.  The  second
line  of  the  header  leaves room for a descriptive string.
This line may be blank, or it may contain  some  information
pertinent to that particular step, but it must exist, and it
must be just one line long.
<P>
Each line of text describing a single atom must  contain  at
least  four  fields of information, separated by whitespace:<br>
the atom's type (a short string of alphanumeric characters),
and  its  x-,  y-, and z-positions. Optionally, extra fields
may be used to specify a charge for the atom, and/or a  vector
associated  with  the  atom.  If an input line contains
five or eight fields, the fifth field is interpreted as  the
atom's  charge;  otherwise, a charge of zero is assumed.  If
an input line contains seven or eight fields, the last three
fields are interpreted as the components of a vector.  These
components should be specified in angstroms.
<P>
The XMOL(XYZ) format doesn't contain connectivity information.
