This widget display a list of detected secondary structures.
<ul>
<li>Helixes and sheet are shown only if PDB file contains appropriate
SHEET and HELIX lines.</li>
<li>Protein chain parts which are not part of any helix or sheet are listed as
LOOPs.</li>
<li>A trace (shown as TRACE) contains all atoms which are in the same protein chain.</li>
</ul>
</P>

<P>
Select button will extract atom information from secondary structure description
and insert it into <a href="plumber_widget.html">Plumber widget</a>. It will also
set the plumber type but there is no restrictions of freedom of choice. So you can
change the type if you like.
</P>
<P>
The &quot;Create all plumbers of this kind&quot; will create a new plumber for each
secondary structure description of the same kind. So in situation of the screen-shot
three helixes would be created.
<br>
Plumber options in Plumber widget are left untouched and plumbers are created immediately.
So you should set the plumber options before clicking this button.
