Define a cutplane trough the contour surface grid data. The planes are
defined to be perpendicular to the x, y and z axis.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to animate or move the planes "smoothly" using the animate
facility behind the "X,Y and Z --->+" buttons. Press respective button
to show the display along the X,Y or Z axis. 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Define first the plane (yz, xz or/and xy) by clicking the selection box.</LI>
<LI> Then define the coordinate of the x,y or/and z axis through which
     the plane will go.</LI>
<LI> Then define the minimum and maximum value of the range.</LI>
<LI> Later there will also be a feature to smooth the range.</LI>
</UL>
<p>
It is also possible to define any plane from three points or atoms.
It is currently possible to define three different such planes.
To define an own plane click on the any of the three buttons
after the text "Define XYZ plane #1/2/3".

It is not always easy to find the best plane (=plain with most information).
To make this procedure a bit easier a "profile graph" can be generated.
The graph is generated by dividing the range of observations in bins 
where the grid data is then placed. A blue colour shows very few observations in that bin,
while a read colour shows a high number of observations in the bin.
The current picture applies a bin cut value of 1.0, which means that the
region shown is the region where there is 1 or more values in the bin.
This bin cut value can be changed by changin the default value 1.0 
in the input widget to an other value. Using the value of 1.0 gives already
a good insight into the grid space. 
</p>
<p>
The horizontal-axis (in the graph) defines the min and max values of the grid data 
and the vertical-axis (in the graph) is the range inside which the plane can move 
along the chosen axis x, y or z axis in the 3D space.
</p>
<p>
The following example shows that an YZ-plane can move along the
x axis (in 3D) between the values -2.0 and 1.9 Angstrom, while 
the grid values varies between 0.0 and 3.397. From the graph one
can read that most information is for a plane at x = 0.0 and a
grid range of 0.0 to 1.6.
