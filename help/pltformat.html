<h1>Format of the binary *.plt file</h1>

<hr>

<p>The *.plt grid data files are the main enginees for ploting
isocontour surfaces. The *.plt files can either be generated
directly by various programs inside the gOpenMol package or be
imported from other programs.</p>

<p>Programs inside gOpenMol generating *.plt grid data files:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <strong>probsurf</strong> program generates the grid
        data for ploting Connolly type of surfaces.</li>
    <li>The <strong>vss</strong> program generates the grid data
        for ploting electrostatic potentials.</li>
</ul>

<p>To assist in moving the binary *.plt files between different
hardware platforms the<strong> pltfile</strong> program is
included. Using the program it is possible to format a binary
grid file move it to an other platform and unformat the file
again. The program can of course also be used interface the grid
data from other programs with gOpenMol.</p>

<p>The *.plt file binary and formatted file formats are very
simple but please observe that unformatted files written with a
FORTRAN program are not pure binary files because there are file
records between the values while pure binary files do not have
any records between the values. gOpenMol should be able to figure
out if the file is pure binary or FORTRAN unformatted but it is
not very well tested.</p>

<h2>Binary *.plt (grid) file format</h2>

<p>Record number and meaning:</p>

<p>#1: Integer, rank value must always be = 3</p>

<p>#2: Integer, possible values are 1 ... 50. This value is not
used but it should define the type of surface!</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Values used (you can use your own value between 1... 50):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>: VSS surface</li>
        <li>: Orbital/density surface</li>
        <li>: Probe surface</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Value 100 is reserved for grid data coming from
    OpenMol!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>#3: Integer, number of points in z direction</p>

<p>#4: Integer, number of points in y direction</p>

<p>#5: Integer, number of points in x direction</p>

<p>#6: Float, zmin value</p>

<p>#7: Float, zmax value</p>

<p>#8: Float, ymin value</p>

<p>#9: Float, ymax value</p>

<p>#10: Float, xmin value</p>

<p>#11: Float, xmax value</p>

<p>#12 ... Float, grid data values running (x is inner loop, then
y and last z):</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Loop in the z direction</li>
        <li>Loop in the y direction</li>
        <li>Loop in the x direction</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The formatted (the first few lines) file can look like:</p>

<h2>Formatted *.plt (grid) file format</h2>

<p>Line numbers and variables on the line:</p>

<p>#1: Integer, Integer. Rank and type of surface (rank is always
= 3)</p>

<p>#2: Integer, Integer, Integer. Zdim, Ydim, Xdim (number of
points in the z,y,x directions)</p>

<p>#3: Float, Float, Float, Float, Float, Float. Zmin, Zmax,
Ymin, Ymax, Xmin,Xmax (min and max values)</p>

<p>#4: ... Float. Grid data values running (x is inner loop, then
y and last z) with one or several values per line:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Loop in the z direction</li>
        <li>Loop in the y direction</li>
        <li>Loop in the x direction</li>
    </ol>

<p><strong>A file in this format can the be converted into binary
with the pltfile program.</strong></p>

<p>For an example of what a formatted *.plt file can look like
please look above.</p>

<p>If you are a programmer please look at the included utility programs
for the code for doing the reading and writing of *.plt files</p>
