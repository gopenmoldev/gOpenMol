Define display properties of the system<BR>

**************************************************************************<BR>
<P>
Define a variety of properties connected to how the molecular system
is displayed on the screen.
</P>
<ol>
<li> Define the background colour. To change colour click at the coloured
     button.</li>

<li> Define the way how the molecular bonds are displayed.</li>
     <ul>
	 <li> Half of the bond distance is displayed in the atom colour
	      <b>(half)</b>.</li>
	 <li> The bond is coloured smoothly from one atom colour to the
	      other atom colour <b>(smooth)</b>.</li>
	 </ul>
<li> Define the way the solid surfaces (polygons) are coloured. This
     property is used when a surface is coloured according to a scale
	 value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is blue, 1.0 is red and 0.5
	 is green. The two possibilities are:
	 <ul>
	 <li>Choose <b>texture</b> to use an one dimensional texture mapping.</li>
	 <li>or <b>rainbow</b> to use a simple interpolation scheme.</li>
	 </ul>
<li> Control into which buffer the drawing is directed. Usually the drawing
     is directed to the back buffer and the buffers are swapped when
	 the scene is drawn. Sometimes it is useful to follow the display of the objects
	 while they are drawn. This vcan be done by directing the draw into the
	 front buffer. The two possibilities are:
     <ul>
	 <li> Draw into the front buffer. This is good for tracing bugs
	      in the display driver.</li>
	 <li> Draw into the back buffer. Normal drawing.</li>
	 </ul>

<li> Facility to control the near clipping plane.</li>
     <ul>
     <li> Define the distance to the near clipping plane. 
	      Press the  <b>-</b> and <b>+</b> buttons to decreases 
		  or increases the distance to the 
	      near clipping plane using the defined step length.</li>
	 <li> The new view will not be displayed before the <b>Display</b> 
	      command is applyed or the <b>gOpenMol</b> logo is pressed.<br>
	      To update the display after the changed value click 
	      the "Instant update" button or press the <b>Apply</b> button..
          </li>
	 </ul>

<li> Facility to control the projection type. The two possible
     projections are:
	 <ul>
	 <li>in <b>perspective</b> projection objects further away are
     are smaller than those in the front</li>
	 <li>and in <b>orthographic</b> projection object size is independent
	 of distance.</li>
	 </ul>
     For the perspective projection it is also possible to define the viewing
     angle. Write ne value and press the "Apply" button.</li>
<li> Define the pixel width of the molecular stick display.</li>

<li> When a new scene is drawn into the buffer the scene can be
     update automaticly or it can wait until the command <b>display</b>
	 is requested. Moving windows can blur the display. Then window
	 can now be redrawn automaticly or it can wait for the (manual) 
	 display command.</li>

<li> It is possible to display some properties in multi windows.
     Turn the multi window display on to display both a structure 
	 and a ldp map at the same time. 
	 </li>
	  
</ol>
