<h1>gOpenMol version 2.0 (31.03.2001)</h1>
<h2>New features in version 2.0</h2>
<ol>
<li>All the discovered bugs in version 1.4 and 1.4p have been corrected.</li>
<li>Cut planes through the grid data can be defined from 3 coordinates (atoms)
    or planes perpendicular to the x, y and z axis.</li>
<li>Clip planes through the grid data can be defined from 3 coordinates (atoms)
    or planes perpendicular to the x, y and z axis.</li>
<li>Coordinate reader has been improved.</li>
<li>Coordinate reader for Jaguar output files.</li>
<li>Filter program to convert Jaguar grid data files into gOpenMol
    plt files.</li>
<li>Filter program to convert "cube" data in PC Gamess PUNCH files into
    gOpenMol plt files.</li> 
</ol>

<h1>gOpenMol version 1.4 (01.06.2000)</h1>

<h2>New features in version 1.4</h2>
<ol>
<li>All the discovered bugs in version 1.3 have been corrected.</li>
<li>New input coordinate formats have been added:
<ol>
     <li>Coordinate input can be read from Amsterdam Density
         Functional (ADF) output log files.</li>
     <li>Coordinates from a GROMACS gro coordinate file.</li>
</ol>
<li>The trajectory readers have been changed to enable the reading
    of binary trajectories indipendent of hardware. In principle it
    should now be able to read trajectories without the need to
    format/unformat them when moving from one hardware platform
    to an other.</li>
<li>New trajectory file format added:
<ol>
    <li>The GROMACS trn/trr/xtc trajectory file types.</li>
</ol>
<li>Binary plt plot files can be moved between hardware platforms
    without the need to reformat them. The gOpenMol plt file reader
    can now do the byte swap on the fly.</li>
<li>It is now possible to select atoms by clicking on them and 
    dragging them into an input widget. This makes it easier
    to pick atoms into input widgets.</li>
<li>All molecular systems read into gOpenMol has its own viewing
    matrix enabling the rotation/translation of individual
    molecules. The two modes are defined as <b>global</b> and
    <b>local</b> transformations. In the <b>global</b> mode all 
    the molecular systems rotate/translate to a common center
    while in the <b>local</b> mode the translation/rotation will
    be according to an individual coordinate center.</b>
<li>To enable quick rotation, translation and picking it is possible 
    to enable the translation mode by pressing the <b>Shift</b> key 
    before one presses the left mouse. As long as the <b>Shift</b> key 
    is and the left mouse button are pressed the structure will 
    translate when the mouse is moved. Be careful to understand 
    that if the <b>Shift</b> key will be released before the left mouse 
    button the Translate state will be left on. In the other case 
    Translate mode will return to Rotate mode.</li>
<li>By pressing the <b>Ctrl</b> key first and keeping it pressed it is 
    possible to pick or mark atoms in the graphics screen by pressing 
    the left mouse button. The selected atom(s) can then be dragged to 
    an input widget. If one releases the <b>Ctrl</b> key before releasing the 
    left mouse button gOpenMol will stay in the picking mode.</li>
<li>Pressing the <b>Alt</b> key and the left mouse button and moving the mouse 
    in the x-axis direction rotates the molecule around the z-axis. This 
    is the same as using the middle mouse on a three button mouse.</li>
<li>In the <b>Edit</b> menu there is now an <b>Atom Browser</b> that opens as
    a tree. The atoms in the tree can be clicked. The clicked atom will
    show up in the graphics screen as being selected. It also works the
    opposite way. Clicking an atom in the graphics window will highlight
    the clicked atom in the atom tree. The atom tree also shows a lot of
    atom information. In the future there will be a feature to edit the
    parameters.</li>

<li>All input file names can be given as a http link and thus be read
    from a Web server. If you know that there is a file named <b>myfile.crd</b>
    on a server named <b>my.server.org</b> the input file name can be given
    as <b>http://my.server.org/myfile.crd</b>.     

<li>Filter program (gamess2plt) to read the "CUBE" information from the 
    PC Gamess v. 6.0 PUNCH file and convert it into a plt file. The
    v. 6.0 of PC Gamess can now produce "CUBE" file information, like
    the information GaussianXX programs produce, into the PUNCH file.

<li>It's now possible to export the molecule(s) in their current
    orientation and possition.

<li>It's now possible to merge two or more structures into one
    with the molecules in their current orientation and positions.

</ol>

<h1>gOpenMol version 1.3 (September 1999)</h1>

<h2>New features in version 1.2</h2>

<ol>
<li>Programming of the 12 function keys. The user can now program
    frequently used commands behind the 12 function keys. Please
    look at the beginning of file <b>data/gopenmol_guirc.tcl</b> 
    file.</li>
<li>It's now possible to put gOpenMol in a full screen mode to support
    the OpenGL PC-display cards.</li>
<li>Atom partial charges can be imported from GaussianXX calculations
    (log files).</li>
<li>Time series can be exported to disk through the graphical GUI.</li>
<li>It is possible to choose which structure is superimposed on which
    structure.</li>
<li>Possibility to edit the light properties.</li>
<li>Possibility to use 9 different light positions. Please look at the
    <b>Edit Light properties</b>.</li>
<li>Possibility to display frame number while displaying a trajectory 
    frame.</li>
<li>Improved tools to analyze AutoDock results (trajectories).</li>
<li>Possibility to display both the structure and a ldp simultaneously.
    Clicking on the ldp window is displayed in the structure window as an
    array connecting the two atoms defining the distance.</li>
<li>Facility to export the polygon coordinates, values and 
    normals from an isocontour display.</li>
<li>Facility to display own polygon data.</li>
<li>Ken Wilson at QTP Florida (http://www.qtp.ufl.edu/Aces2/) has prepared 
    a filter for the display of ACES II properties using gOpenMol.</li> 
<li>A filter routine written by Jonas Juselius, Department of Chemistry, 
    University of Helsinki, to convert TURBOMOLE moloch grids 
    into a format recongized by gOpenMol. Please look into the utility/turbotools
    directory.</li>
<li>An improved version (g94cub2pl.c) of the gcube2plt.c by Doug 
    Moffatt, Technical Officer National Research Council of 
    Canada. Please look into the utility/ directory</li>
