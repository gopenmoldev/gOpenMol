Plot stereo pair ("crossed eye") widget<BR>

<P>
It is possible to generate a stereo pair or "crossed eye" view of a system.
The view is built by duplicating the object, with a defined distance, and rotating 
the two pictures with a small angle. 
</P>
<P>
There are two values that have to be defined: 
<ul>
    <li> The distance with which the objects are separated.</li>
    <li> The angle with which the objects are "tilted". The left object
         is "tilted" -angle and the right object +angle around the
         y-axis.</li>
</ul>
<P>
Usually there is no need to change the "tilt" angle but the distance
between the two images of the structure needs to be specified.
</P>
<p>
Click on the Display state: "On" and theon the "Apply" button to activate
the display. If you need to change the distance between the two images
write in a new value into the widget and press the "Apply" button.

The display should look like the following when the "crossed" eye stereo
is on.
