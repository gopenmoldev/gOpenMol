This widget is helpful when one wants to recalculate atom connections (bonds)
in case you you have deleted some or if you don't get all hydrogen atoms
bonded in your structure.
</p>
<p>
gOpenMol uses a very simple algorithm to calculate possible bonds. It
runs over all the atoms in the structure and uses a window (range)
of atoms inside which it thinks the bonded atoms are located. By default
there is a range defined (use <b>show atom window</b> command to
display the current value) so when gOpenMol looks at atom N it checks
range atoms backwards and range atoms forward from atom N to find
the bonded neighbours. Some programs place added hydrogens at the end
of the file, which might prevent gOpenMol from finding the right bonds.
</p>
<p>
To solve this problem the range can be redefined. Please supply a new 
value, inside which you think all bonded atoms will be.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to recalculate the connectivity only for a set of
atoms.
