<P>The powerful Tcl scripting language enables the usage of very nice scripts. I will in the future program a lot of the new functionality through the Tcl scripts. Currently there are just a few one available: </P>

<UL>
<B><LI>m_distance x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2</B> calculates and returns the distance from point (x1,y1,z1) to (x2,y2,z2) </LI>
<B><LI>m_angle x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3</B> calulates and returns the angle between the points (x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2) and (x3,y3,z3) </LI>
<B><LI>m_torsion x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 x4 y4 z4</B> calculates and returns the torsion angle between the points (x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2), (x3,y3,z3) and (x4,y4,z4) </LI>
<B><LI>p_rmsd Segment Residue Atom Scale</B> <B>fit/nofit</B> calculates and plots the root means square displacement for the selected atoms (segment,residue,atom) multiplied Scale times as ellipsoids showing the atom vibration divided into the x, y and z directions </LI></UL>
