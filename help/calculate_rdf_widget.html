Calculate radial distribution function widget<br>

<P>
It is possible to calculate a distribution function (g(r)) for an atom
using gOpenMol from one frame or as an average from a sequence of frames 
like a molecular dynamics simulation. It is possible to arbitrarily choose 
the center atom and the atom around that.
</P>
<P>
<h2>A trajectory file is not defined</h2>
If you have only one frame available (you have not a trajectory file defined)
and you select the "Calculate RDF" from the "Calculate" pulldown menu you will
get the following widget:
</P>  
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict/calc_rdf1.gif">
</P>
<P>
The "From atom(s):" define the center atom(s) around which the distribution will
be calculated. The "To atom(s):" define the atom(s) which distribution will be
calculated.  
</P>
<P>
The "Rcut:" value defines the distance to which the distribution will be calculated
and "Nbins:" define the number of intermediate values (bins) for which the distribution
will be calulated.
</P>
<P>
If the periodic cell (most likely you have been using period boundaries), inside which
your atoms and molecules are located, has not been defined before it has to be defined 
here.
</P>
<P>
Pressing now the "Apply" button calculates the radial distribution function of the
"To atom(s)" around the "From atom(s)" for the structure displayed in the graphics window.
</P>
<P>
After pressing the "Apply" button" one gets the following widget:

</P>
<P>
There is now one furter entry and button displayed. An entry titled "Number of sets"
defining for how many structures the RDF has been calculated and accumulated. It is thus
possible to read by hand more frames into gOpenMol and successively calculate the RDF.
</P>
<P>
After the number of RDFs has been calculated (accumulated) it is possible to calculate
the average for these RDFs by pressing the "calc average" button.
</P>
<P>
<h2>A trajectory file has been defined</h2>
However, if a trajectory file has been defined <b>before</b> the "Calculate RDF" is
selected from the "Calculate" pulldown menu one gets the following widget:
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="pict/calc_rdf3.gif">
</P>
<P>
It is now possible to automaticly calculate the average for all the frames
in the trajectory file by pressing the "Calculate average RDF" button. 
gOpenMol goes now through your trajectory file frame by frame and 
calculates and accumulates the RDF. The first frame, last frame and
step frame numbers
are taken from "Trajectory Main" widget. After the last frame an average 
RDF is calculated.
</P>
<P>
It is always possible to export the calculated (accumulated) RDF through the 
"export rdf" command or the "Export" pulldown menu. On the Windows platform 
it is also possible to copy the RDF to the Paste buffer through the 
"Edit" - "Copy" - "RDF" pulldown menu.
