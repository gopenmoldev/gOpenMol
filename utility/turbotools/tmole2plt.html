 *   This is a small program to convert TURBOMOLE moloch grids 
 *   into a format recongized by gOpenMol. The proram is loosely
 *   based on code written originally by Leif Laaksonen at
 *   Centre for Scientific Computing , ESPOO, FINLAND.
 *  
 *   Usage: $ tmole2plt {infile} {outfile}
 *     ex.: $ tmole2plt density.dat density.plt
 *
 *   Oh, yes... This program is supplied as is, and comes without any kind 
 *   of WARRANTY what so ever! If you have problems, you can try to contact
 *   me by mail (if you can find me that iz :^). 
 *   Also, sorry for the lack of comments ;)
